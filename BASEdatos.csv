862;48;Beautiful!;"Tried this on today at my local retailer and had to have it. it is so comfortable and flattering. it's too bad the picture online has the model tucking it into the skirt because you can't see the ruching across the front. a little dressier alternative to a plain tee and reasonably priced for retailer. 5'8"""" and i generally wear a 6, the small fit well. will probably be back for the black!";5;1;9;General;Tops;Knits
862;43;Love the two tone design;I bought this item from online... the fit on the model looked a little loose but when i got mine it seemed a bit tight! so i took it back to the store & ordered a larger size. for the sale price this is a great top.;4;1;0;General;Tops;Knits
862;40;;I love this top. i wear it all the time.  the problem is that you can tell i wear it all the time as the fabric has started to fade.  i'd still recommend it as it is so comfortable.;5;1;0;General;Tops;Knits
862;33;Love the embroidery!;Really cute top! the embroidery on the collar & bib of this top is beautiful and unique, received lots of compliments & questions about where i got it. i'm rather busty up top and the medium fit well, a small probably would've fit better but it's still super adorable.;5;1;0;General;Tops;Knits
862;46;Cute for fall;This is a cute top that can transition easily from summer to fall. it fits well, nice print and it's comfortable. i tried this on in the store, but did not purchase it because the color washed me out. this is not the best color for a blonde. would look much better on a brunette. if this was in a different color i most likely would have purchased it.;4;1;1;General;Tops;Knits
862;41;Love;"I absolutely love this bib tee! it's probably my favorite retailer purchase of all time. i'm 5'7"", 140 pounds and the small was a perfect fit for me. i typically wear either a s or m tops.";5;1;2;General;Tops;Knits
862;39;Flattering and comfortable;Very soft and comfortable. the shirt has an unusual, asymmetrical seam that appears along the front, right-hand side of the garment. (the model is positioned so that you can't see this detail from the picture. i attached a picture that includes the front seam.) i actually like the seam - it creates more visual interest, and adds a little bit of ruching that helps hide my belly. the cowl neck is very well done - there are two layers that form the cowl, and i've found that it means wardrobe malfun;5;1;34;General;Tops;Knits
862;66;Cute top;Nice top. armholes are a bit oversized but as an older woman, i'm picky about that. the print is pretty and unusual. it just didn't look great on me. there's a slight peplum in the back that hangs nicely. it's a lightweight tee fabric that's opaque. i tried it on with a black bra which was barely visible. great for warmer climates but there are so many gorgeous tops out now, that i decided to return since summer is winding down. i do recommend.;4;1;2;General;Tops;Knits
862;61;Soft and cute as can be!;This is an adorable top that i find to be extremely comfortable. i don't usually buy prints but this one is so feminine and looks great with dark wash jeans. i am a 36d and the medium was a perfect fit.;5;1;2;General;Tops;Knits
862;41;;i don’t like the material , so uncomfortable;1;0;0;General;Tops;Knits
862;31;Boring front, great back;This tank fit well and i loved the ruffle in the back and how it layed. but the front was not a good look and i will be retuning it.;3;0;0;General;Tops;Knits
862;28;Must have;I recently got this on sale after looking at it forever on my wish list. i'm so happy with it. its very comfortable and just long enough for my torso (5'3). the pattern on the front is very flattering.;5;1;0;General;Tops;Knits
862;57;Cute top! love the brand;Very comfortable shirt, light weight top with lovely floral colors. great for spring/summer with white jeans. love everything one september makes!;5;1;1;General;Tops;Knits
862;43;Love this top;Loved this top and was really happy to find it on sale!;5;1;0;General;Tops;Knits
862;58;;Beautiful top, but delicate! i wore it to school and the straps on my backpack caused some pilling. other than that it is beautiful and vibrant! just make sure you aren't doing/wearing anything that will rub it continuously since the fabric is delicate;4;1;2;General;Tops;Knits
862;60;Super cute and unique top;Just received this in the mail, tried it on and am smitten. i'm usually a l, but sometimes i'm a xl (if no stretch), in retailer tops. i bought this one in l and i'm sure glad i did. very flowy, stretchy and comfortable. i also bought the meda lace top from one september and they are very similar expect this is more of a t-shirt and the other is more of a blouse. i almost think i could've gotten a m in this because there is a lot of extra fabric at the chest which is usually never the issue for me;4;1;9;General;Tops;Knits
862;40;Beautiful top;Love this top! i kept eyeing it online and wavering on size, since my post-baby body is a little wonky. i went with the xsp, and miraculously, it works perfectly! so, i would say it does run just a little large..... i love the length, and usually do not go with petite sizes at retailer because i like the longer lengths of the regular. but this is perfect on me, and there is give up top, so it looks lovely. and it is very soft and comfortable. this will be a go-to top this season!;5;1;1;General;Tops;Knits
862;52;;Uncomfortable details not visible in the pictures The online model hides the front ruching and an asymmetrical seam that isn’t flattering. Plus, the buttons at the back of the neck are hard to fasten without help, making it inconvenient to wear.;1;0;0;General Petite;Tops;Knits
862;37;I wanted to love this top...;I really loved this top online and wanted to love it in person. it is soft and the patter is okay in person. the neckline is higher than i am used to. also, there are two buttons in the back that must be unbuttoned in order to wear the top. it is difficult to button them behind your neck with the top on. unfortunately i had to return this item...;2;0;0;General;Tops;Knits
862;30;Comfy, casual shirt;Happy with this top- slightly thinner material than i was expecting but that'll be fine with our hot summers. got the navy striped one- very pretty and extremely soft. washes well. i do wear an tank underneath though bc the armholes are slightly large and you can see part of my bra.;4;1;4;General;Tops;Knits
862;26;A great piece;I bought this shirt in the neutral and white and love it. so many people compliment it. i usually pair it with white pants and cute wedges to dress it up (obviously with a statement necklace too). but the greatest thing about this shirt is the fact that you can also dress it down. the material is fabulous but i have not washed it yet so i am not sure if it is going to shrink (which i hope it doesn't because it is one of my favorite pieces). ;5;1;2;General Petite;Tops;Knits
862;35;Extra fabric in back adds a lot;"I got to try this on today and i really like it. the fabric is a normal t-shirt kind of fabric (i was hoping it would have been kind of special) and the v-neck in the front does go down a ways so that some cleavage is showing. i would feel comfortable wearing it as-is outside of work, but would have to pair it with a cami if i would going to wear it to work. normally, i am not a huge fan of v-neck in the back and it drives me crazy thanks cami's these days are often made with a ""versatile"" v and";5;1;6;General;Tops;Knits
862;42;Poor quality;"I bought this in the white, size m (140lbs., 5'8"", 34b) because i wanted a baggy fit, which i got, so this is tts. the white is more of an off-white rather than a bright white, which i like because i happen to be looking for an off-white tee. and the shape is good--even in a larger size, this tee nips in at the waist.however, the quality of this tee is lacking, as it is the typical, cheap, marled, slightly see-through material that seems to be everywhere these days and the band on the back of th";2;0;2;General;Tops;Knits
862;35;Runs large;Soft cotton in very stylish yet simple style. regrettably, i listened to reviews that said it ran tts and ended up w a baggy long one that won't work even if i shrink it. that will teach me-- always order multiple sizes!;4;1;0;General Petite;Tops;Knits
862;38;;Uncomfortable I won’t be buying from this brand again. the color faded and the fabric started pilling;0;0;0;General Petite;Tops;Knits
